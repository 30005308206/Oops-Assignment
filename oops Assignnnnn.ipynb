        "# OOPs Assignment - Theory Answers\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects that encapsulate data and behavior together.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (behavior) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It contains actual data and can perform functions defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "- **Abstraction** hides implementation details and shows only essential features.\n",
        "- **Encapsulation** restricts direct access to some data, ensuring controlled interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Dunder (double underscore) methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__repr__` are special methods that Python uses to define object behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire properties and methods from another class (parent), promoting code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism allows methods to take different forms depending on the object calling them, enabling flexibility and reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved using private (`_var`) and protected (`__var`) attributes, which restrict direct access to class members.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "A constructor (`__init__`) is a special method in a class that initializes an object when it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- **Class methods** (using `@classmethod`) operate on the class itself.\n",
        "- **Static methods** (using `@staticmethod`) do not operate on the class or instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Python does not support method overloading directly but allows default arguments to achieve similar behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "Method overriding allows a child class to redefine a method inherited from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "`@property` is a built-in decorator that allows defining getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism enhances code reusability and flexibility by allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "An abstract class cannot be instantiated and must contain at least one abstract method, defined using `@abstractmethod`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Modularity\n",
        "- Code reusability\n",
        "- Scalability\n",
        "- Easier maintenance\n",
        "\n",
        "## 17. Difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "- **Class variables** are shared among all instances.\n",
        "- **Instance variables** are unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 19. Purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python\n",
        "- `__str__` returns a readable representation.\n",
        "- `__repr__` returns an unambiguous representation for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 20. Significance of the `super()` function in Python\n",
        "`super()` allows access to parent class methods and attributes in a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 21. Significance of the `__del__` method in Python\n",
        "`__del__` is a destructor method called when an object is deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 22. Difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`\n",
        "- `@staticmethod`: Does not require access to class attributes.\n",
        "- `@classmethod`: Operates on the class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "Child classes can redefine methods inherited from parent classes, allowing different behavior based on the object calling them.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Method chaining allows calling multiple methods on an object in a single statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 25. Purpose of the `__call__` method in Python\n",
        "The `__call__` method allows an object to be called like a function."
